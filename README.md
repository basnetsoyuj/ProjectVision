Project Vision is a cross-platform mobile application project developed as a term-project for Computer 
Programming for Engineering course at New York University Abu Dhabi which incorporates Machine Learning
and Artificial Intelligence to help visually impaired people recognize different objects and distinguish
between different currency bills.

We plan to expand Project Vision by increasing the accuracy of the machine learning model.
